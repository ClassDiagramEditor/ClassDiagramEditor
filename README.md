### The work with plug-in

<p align='justify'> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the plug-in has been installed, the work with it can finally start. There are two ways we can start it up. The first one which is situated in the upper right corner , generates the diagram from the project, and it is indicated as the main one.The main project can be set up by clicking the folder Run as you can see in the Picture number 3.
If the mouse coursor points the Set Main Project , the opened projects appear. We choose the project we want to be the main one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is simpler and does not need the main project setting. You just click the right side mouse button on the project you want to generate the diagram from .
If you do so, all present alternatives available for the project appear. If you want to generate the diagram you choose from possibilities given in Generate Class Diagram, as it can be seen in the Picture number 2.
These are two ways how the generating of the diagram from the chosen project can start.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having generated the diagram, you can continue working with the application. Picture n.4 you can see under the texte. We are going to use mainly the spots marked in red colour as it is easier to find and explain as well.
<br />   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We start in the left upper corner, when the section n.1 begins. By the means of this section, we can change the font size. The maximal font size is 18, the minimal one is 8. It is possible to change the font size by the means of buttons + and -.
<br />  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the means of number 2 section, we can display or hide the in between classes associations. If we display the in between classes  associations, the sections 3 and 4 are interesting for us too. By the means of them, we can adapt the way of displaying these in between classes associations. If the associations are on, we can additionally put on displaying the attributes implementing the associations as well and if the displaying of these attributes is on, we can put the associations names off.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 5 section displays or hides constructors and number 6 section – if it is on – it displays diagrams in colour. If this section is off, they are displayed in black and white.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2 buttons right in the upper tool panel. The first one is Export XMI / section number 8 /, through which we get  diagram format XMI and in section number 9, there is Export Image, through which we get the diagram as the picture form.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the right side panel which we use for the source file modifying thourough the diagram. At the top, there is section number 7, by the means of it we can delete the indicated element. The element is indicated by simple clicking. The indicated element is easy to be distinguished as the element edges are visibly highlighted. We can see the indicated element exemple also in the picture number 4 on the left. This indicated class influences directly the whole right side menu.
Under deleting, there is  another section – section number 10.Thtough this section we can add immerged classes.
On the other hand, in section 11 , we can adapt the element name. The last three menu sections on the right / sections number 12, 13 and 14 / are used for editing and variables or methods creating.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section number 15 is the last one and it appears after right side mouse button clicking  e.g. on the package or class. It can add us other useful alternatives.
